<objective>
Visual QA and reference alignment for core screens: Loading, Player Selection, Home.

Purpose: Ensure these foundation screens match the reference designs exactly, establishing visual quality baseline for the app.
Output: All 3 core screens visually match Reference_*.png images with no deviations.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Loading Screen Visual Alignment</name>
  <files>BennieGame/BennieGame/Features/Loading/LoadingView.swift</files>
  <action>
Compare current LoadingView against Reference_Loading Screen.png and adjust to match:

1. Open reference image and note exact layout:
   - Title sign "Waldabenteuer" position (top center, rope-mounted)
   - Bennie position and size (left of center, ~200x300pt, waving)
   - Lemminge positions (4-5 peeking from tree holes)
   - Progress bar style (berry-decorated log at bottom center, ~600x40pt)
   - Loading text "Lade Spielewelt..." below progress bar

2. Verify forest background layers:
   - 4-layer parallax depth
   - Warm golden light from upper-left
   - Forest colors matching palette (#4A6B5C far, #738F66 mid, #7A9973 near)

3. Fix any deviations:
   - Adjust element positions to match reference exactly
   - Ensure wooden sign has visible grain texture
   - Verify rope mounting on title sign
   - Check Bennie is brown #8C7259, NO clothing

AVOID: Changing touch target sizes (already validated). Changing any color hex values (already validated).
  </action>
  <verify>Run simulator, take screenshot of LoadingView, visually compare to Reference_Loading Screen.png - layout should match exactly</verify>
  <done>LoadingView matches Reference_Loading Screen.png with no visible deviations in layout, positioning, or visual style</done>

  <how-to-verify>
    1. Run: xcodebuild -project BennieGame/BennieGame.xcodeproj -scheme BennieGame -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Pro 13-inch (M4)' build
    2. Launch simulator and app
    3. Compare Loading Screen to: design/references/screens/Reference_Loading Screen.png
    4. Check:
       - Title sign position and style matches reference
       - Bennie position, size, and animation matches
       - Lemminge positions match reference
       - Progress bar style matches (berry-decorated log)
       - Forest background layers visible
       - Overall visual feel matches magical forest theme

  <name>Task 2: Player Selection Screen Visual Alignment</name>
  <files>BennieGame/BennieGame/Features/PlayerSelection/PlayerSelectionView.swift</files>
  <action>
Compare current PlayerSelectionView against Reference_Player_Selection_Screen.png and adjust to match:

1. Note exact layout from reference:
   - Title "Wer spielt heute?" position (top center, 32pt)
   - Alexander button position (left ~x=400, 160x180pt with photo/avatar)
   - Oliver button position (right ~x=800, 160x180pt with photo/avatar)
   - Bennie position (center bottom, ~180x280pt, waving/welcoming)
   - Lemminge (2 watching from corners)

2. Verify button styling:
   - Wooden sign appearance with grain texture
   - Player name below avatar
   - Proper spacing between buttons

3. Fix any deviations:
   - Adjust positions to match reference layout
   - Ensure forest background consistent with Loading screen
   - Verify button visual state (hover/press feedback)

AVOID: Changing button functionality. Changing touch target sizes.

  <files>BennieGame/BennieGame/Features/Home/HomeView.swift</files>
  <action>
Compare current HomeView against Reference_Menu_Screen.png and adjust to match:

1. Note exact layout from reference:
   - Title sign "Waldabenteuer" (top center, ~500x100pt, wooden sign)
   - Player icon (top right, 60x60pt)
   - Activity buttons in 2x2 grid:
     * Ratsel (top left) - hanging from branch
     * Zahlen (top right) - hanging from branch
     * Zeichnen (bottom left) - LOCKED with chains
     * Logik (bottom right) - LOCKED with chains
   - Treasure chest (bottom right, ~100x100pt)
   - Settings gear (bottom left corner, 48x48pt)
   - Help icon (bottom center, 48x48pt)
   - Bennie (right side, ~180x280pt, pointing at activities)
   - Lemminge (1-2 in log/corners)

2. Verify activity card styling:
   - Wooden sign with grain texture
   - Rope mounting visible
   - Unlocked cards: warm wood, golden glow
   - Locked cards: dimmed, X-pattern chains, padlock visible

3. Fix any deviations:
   - Adjust layout to match reference exactly
   - Ensure locked/unlocked visual states correct
   - Verify hanging animation subtle swing

AVOID: Changing activity unlocking logic. Changing navigation behavior.

  <verify>Run simulator, navigate to Home screen, take screenshot, compare to Reference_Menu_Screen.png</verify>

    1. Launch app in simulator
    2. At Loading screen, wait for completion
    3. Compare Player Selection to: design/references/screens/Reference_Player_Selection_Screen.png
       - Check button positions and styling
       - Verify Bennie and Lemminge positions
       - Confirm title text and positioning
    4. Select a player, navigate to Home
    5. Compare Home to: design/references/screens/Reference_Menu_Screen.png
       - Check activity card positions and hanging style
       - Verify locked items show chains correctly

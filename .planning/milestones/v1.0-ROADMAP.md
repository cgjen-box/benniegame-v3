## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| SwiftUI + SwiftData | Native iPad performance, local-only storage | Good |
| WKWebView for YouTube | Full control over playback, no ads | Good |
| Lottie PNG-embedded | Simpler than vector, character-consistent | Good |
| ElevenLabs German voices | Natural-sounding, child-appropriate | Good |
| Math gate for parents | Simple but effective, no memorized PIN | Good |
| CDP over MCP for Ludo.ai | More reliable automation | Good |
| Gemini 3.0 for keyframes | Character consistency across animations | Good |

**Issues Resolved:**

- YouTube embed controls hidden via CSS injection
- Voice ducking with configurable durations
- Ludo.ai automation via CDP (click thumbnails, not buttons)
- Export sprite selection via img.parentElement

**Issues Deferred:**

- DEFER-001: Zeichnen (Drawing) activity — post-MVP
- DEFER-002: Logik (Logic) activity — post-MVP
- DEFER-003 to DEFER-012: Various enhancements (see .gsd/ISSUES.md)

**Technical Debt:**

- Voice audio files need actual generation (placeholder structure exists)
- Some animations may need timing adjustments after real-device testing
- Lottie files not yet added to Xcode build (manual step required)

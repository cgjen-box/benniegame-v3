# PROJECT.md — Bennie Bear Learning Game

> **Core project definition. Always loaded for context.**

## Vision

**Bennie Bear** is an autism-friendly educational iPad game for children ages 4-5, specifically designed for Alexander (5, autism spectrum) and Oliver (4).

A magical forest adventure where children learn numbers, puzzles, logic, and drawing through play — earning YouTube time as rewards.

## Problem

- Neurodivergent children need learning approaches that match their needs
- Traditional educational apps are overstimulating, punitive, or confusing
- Screen time is a powerful motivator but needs structure

## Solution

A calming, journey-based learning experience in a magical forest world with:
- **Bennie the Bear** as a gentle guide (brown, no clothing)
- **Blue Lemminge** as playful companions
- **Super Forest Design** - wooden UI, warm lighting, parallax backgrounds
- **Positive-only feedback** - never "wrong", only gentle redirection
- **Coin rewards** → YouTube time exchange

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Alexander (5, autism spectrum) and Oliver (4)
- **Secondary**: Parents managing screen time and learning
- **Platform**: iPad (10th gen+, landscape)

## Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Autism-friendly** | 96pt touch targets, no red/neon, no flashing |
| **Journey-based** | Progress through discovery, not drilling |
| **Positive only** | No "wrong", only encouragement |
| **Visual consistency** | Same characters, same world, always |
| **Predictable** | Clear patterns, gentle transitions |

## Tech Stack

- **Platform**: Native iPad (SwiftUI + SwiftData)
- **Animation**: Lottie (PNG-embedded JSON)
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs German
- **Build**: Xcode, MacinCloud remote

## Non-Goals

- NOT for App Store (private family app)
- NOT multiplayer
- NOT cloud-synced (local only)
- NOT supporting iPhone

## Success Metrics

1. Kids want to play without prompting
2. No meltdowns from app frustration
3. Learning happens (numbers, shapes, etc.)
4. Screen time stays structured
